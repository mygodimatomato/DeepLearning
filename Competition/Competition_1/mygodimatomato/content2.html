     Google took a stand of sorts against
     <a href="http://mashable.com/category/patent-lawsuit-theater/">
      patent-lawsuit theater
     </a>
     Thursday with its new
     <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/opnpledge/" target="_blank">
      Open Patent Non-Assertion (OPN) Pledge
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     As
     <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/taking-stand-on-open-source-and-patents.html" target="_blank">
      explained by Google's Duane Valz
     </a>
     , under the OPN Pledge, Google promises "not to sue any user, distributor or developer of open-source software on specified patents, unless first attacked."
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, Google isn't making all of its patents available for others. Instead, its starting small with
     <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/opnpledge/patents/" target="_blank">
      10 patents
     </a>
     focused on MapReduce, a programming model for handling large data sets. There are already open-sourced versions of MapReduce available — including Hadoop — that are widely used across the Internet. Google says that over time, it plans to extend the OPN Pledge to more Google patents.
    </p>

      </div>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     The big caveat here is that Google is pledging not to sue anyone who uses its MapReduce patents for Free or Open Source Software. Google is
     <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/opnpledge/pledge/" target="_blank">
      defining Free or Open Source software
     </a>
     as any software that meets the Open Source Initiative's "Open Source Definition," as well as any version of the Free Software Foundation's "Free Software Definition." Still, Google iterates that the OPN Pledge isn't limited to a specific project or open-source copyright — as long as the project meets the FSF or OSI's definition for Free Software or Open Source Software, it's protected by the OPN Pledge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Google hopes that its OPN Pledge can be a model for other companies who are looking at how to "put their own patents into the service of open-source software."
    </p>
    <p>
     In the short-term, we're not sure what this does — except indemnify the open source MapReduce projects from a Google lawsuit. The bigger picture, however, is that this could be a new model for the way that patents are applied to open source as a whole. And that's a good thing.
